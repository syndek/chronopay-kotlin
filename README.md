# ChronoPay (Kotlin Edition)

This is an experimental version of my plugin [ChronoPay](https://github.com/syndek/chronopay) built using the
Kotlin programming language. This build is based on version 2.0.1, the latest available at the time of this commit
(2020-11-08). I don't plan to actively maintain this repository, as this endeavour was more experimental in nature
and mostly for my own fun. However, as Kotlin develops and gathers traction outside of Android, we may, at some point,
begin to see more Bukkit plugins developed using it and all the advantages it brings over Java.
